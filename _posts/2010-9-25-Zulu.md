title: Introducing Zulu - A Suite of µTorrent Apps
---
## Winner of the µTorrent App Developers Challenge

Zulu consists of two incredible apps allowing you to discover and download free music and your favorite TV shows. Both apps consist of an intuitive simple interface built inside µTorrent allowing browsing, searching, downloading and playback all in one place. Zulu apps require the latest [µTorrent beta client named Project Griffin](http://www.utorrent.com/labs/griffin). Installing the apps is simple and only requires a few clicks. Once the app installs, they will be updated automatically.

### Zulu Music

Zulu Music utlizes the [Jamendo](http://www.jamendo.com/en/) [API](http://developer.jamendo.com/en/) allowing the ability to browse and search for free, legal and unlimited music published under Creative Commons licenses. It is extremely easy to find all the albums from an artist and download all of their work in a few clicks. All albums are available in both MP3 and OGG formats.

### Zulu TV

Zulu TV combines the most recent television torrents uploaded to [EZTV](http://eztv.it/) and beautiful artwork from [theTVDB](http://thetvdb.com/). It is easy to see all the recent episodes of the selected show, and the ability to download an episode in a variety of qualities, such as HDTV or 720p. A powerful search feature allows you to find shows that may not be recent but you are interested in, allowing you to download past episodes that were uploaded to EZTV. Zulu TV also has the ability to subscribe to the RSS Feed of a show, and have recent TV shows download automatically when they are uploaded to EZTV.
